# TSP_TA

C++ project implementing the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** using the **Simulated Anealing/Threshold Accepting** heuristic.  
The project uses **Meson** as the build system and **Ninja** as the backend.

---

## Requirements

Make sure the following dependencies are installed (Debian/Ubuntu):

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential meson ninja-build pkg-config libsqlite3-dev
```

### Build
#### 1. Create the build directory
```bash
meson setup buildDir
```
#### 2. Compile
```bash
 meson compile -C buildDir
```
### Run

After compiling, the binary will be available in buildDir/. Run it with:

```bash
./buildDir/tsp_ta
```

## (Optional) Run as a Meson test

If the executable is configured as a test in the meson.build file, you can also run:

```bash
meson test -C buildDir
```
### Project Structure
```bash
.
├── main.cpp          # Main source file
├── meson.build       # Meson build configuration
├── buildDir/         # Build directory (generated by Meson)
│   ├── tsp_ta        # Generated binary
│   └── ...           # Build artifacts
```

## Notes

If you modify the code (main.cpp or other sources), rebuild with:

`meson compile -C buildDir`


To clean and rebuild from scratch:

```bash
rm -rf buildDir
meson setup buildDir
meson compile -C buildDir
```
